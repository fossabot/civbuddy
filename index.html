title: Original Civilization Board Game Utility
layout: markdown

## Welcome to {{ site.name }}.

{{ site.name }} is designed to support players of Francis Tresham's original Civilization board game by helping with the tactical planning when buying civilization cards in game phase 10.
This is not a computer game, but a helper application for the board game. In later stages of the game, the game rules lead to phases of long-winded calculations in the upper three-digit numbers. With {{ site.name }}, this can be solved quickly and easily, so everyone can concentrate on all the fun parts of the game.

- Displays the current cost for each civilization card, considering the player's current bonus situation
- Funds and treasury are taken into account
- Detail information on each civilization card is available
- Calculates if the point target can still be reached via civilization cards, and if not, how far off the player is
- Shows how certain purchase decisions would influence future bonuses

- Supports multiple players ("hot seat"), which is useful if there are fewer smartphones than players
- Works on mobile devices as well as desktop PCs, on all modern operating systems
- Although it's a web app, it may be used offline
- Full privacy: All data is saved in your web browser, nothing is transmitted to the server
- It can be taught to know your house rules (within limits)
- Three game variants already supported ([original](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71/civilization) (1980), [with western expansion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/2058/civilization-western-extension-map) (1988), and [advanced](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/177/advanced-civilization) (1991))

Pro Tip: Talk to your fellow players beforehand, and get them all to agree on using {{ site.name }}.

## Development Setup

This website is primarily intended to centralize development related information.

### Setting up a local development workspace

In order to build {{ site.name }} yourself, follow these steps:

 1. Make sure you have the prerequisites set up:
   - [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
   - [Java 7 SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)
   - [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome). Yes, development of a GWT program requires Chrome these days.
 1. Make sure that your environment variable `JAVA_HOME` points to the Java&nbsp;7 SDK, for example `C:\PROGRA~1\Java\jdk1.7.0_80` (Windows).
 1. `JAVA_HOME/bin` should be on the `PATH`
 1. If you don't have a Gradle User Home yet, set it up by creating an empty directory called `.gradle` somewhere, for example `d:\.gradle` (Windows) or `~/.gradle` (Unix). Create an environment variable `GRADLE_USER_HOME` which points to this directory. This directory may grow quite large over time (mine is 2&nbsp;GB), because Gradle uses it to cache all downloaded stuff.
 1. Clone the {{ site.name }} repo by running on the command line:
 
        git clone https://github.com/{{ site.github }}.git

 1. `cd civbuddy`
 1. `gradlew build`
     This will take care of everything needed for a successful build of {{ site.name }}, including download and installation of Gradle.

In order to run {{ site.name }} in development mode, follow these steps:

 1. Make sure that {{ site.name }} was built ok in accordance with the above.
 1. Now, run `gradlew jettyDraftWar`. The WAR file will be assembled and a Jetty application server started. Don't worry about any installation or configuration effort, that's all taken care of by Gradle. The build will appear suspended at a line something like this:
 
        > Building 83% > :jettyDraftWar > Running at http://localhost:8080/civbuddy

    which is good; it means your Jetty server is running fine. Just leave it at that.
 1. In a new shell, run `gradlew gwtSuperDev`. [Super Dev Mode](http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/superdevmode.html) is required these days in order to develop a GWT program. The original development mode which was based on browser plugins is no longer supported by GWT. The output should include a line something like
 
        The code server is ready at http://localhost:9876/

    and subsequently remain "stuck" like the previous call. This is good, it means Super Dev mode is up and running!
 1. Start Chrome and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/civbuddy`, the address at which your Jetty server is listening.
 1. From the Chrome menu, select *More tools* &rarr; *Developer Tools* or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> to call up the development environment. You can browse the sources, debug them, or view the application log from here.

The {{ site.name }} code as found on GitHub is IDE agnostic, so you may use your favorite IDE to edit the sources. Please make sure that IDE specific control files are never committed to git. In order to activate changes from your IDE in Super Dev Mode, press *Compile* on the *Dev Mode On* bookmarklet as described in the [Super Dev Mode](http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/superdevmode.html) docs.
