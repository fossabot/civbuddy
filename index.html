## Welcome to CivBuddy.

CivBuddy is designed to support players of Francis Tresham's original Civilization board game by helping with the tactical planning when buying civilization cards.
It has no artificial intelligence, and it does not play the game for you. This is not a computer game. The players gain no tactical advantage, but it saves time for everyone so that all players can concentrate on the fun parts of the game.

- It supports multiple players ("hot seat"), which is useful if there are fewer smartphones than players
- It works on mobile devices as well as desktop PCs, on all modern operating systems
- Although it's a web app, it may be used offline
- Full privacy: All data is saved in your web browser, nothing is transmitted to the server
- It can be taught to know your house rules (within limits)
- Three game variants already supported ([original](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71/civilization) (1980), [with western expansion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/2058/civilization-western-extension-map) (1988), and [advanced](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/177/advanced-civilization) (1991))

## Development Setup

This website is primarily intended to centralize development related information.

### Setting up a local development workspace

In order to build {{ site.name }} yourself, follow these steps:

 1. Make sure you have the prerequisites set up:
   - [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
   - [Java 7 SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)
 1. Make sure that your environment variable `JAVA_HOME` points to the Java&nbsp;7 SDK, for example `C:\PROGRA~1\Java\jdk1.7.0_80` (Windows).
 1. `JAVA_HOME/bin` should be on the `PATH`
 1. If you don't have a Gradle User Home yet, set it up by creating an empty directory called `.gradle` somewhere, for example `d:\.gradle` (Windows) or `~/.gradle` (Unix). Create an environment variable `GRADLE_USER_HOME` which points to this directory. This directory may grow quite large over time (mine is 2&nbsp;GB), because Gradle uses it to cache all downloaded stuff.
 1. Clone the {{ site.name }} repo by running on the command line:
     `git clone https://github.com/{{ site.github }}.git`
 1. `cd civbuddy`
 1. `gradlew build`
     This will take care of everything needed for a successful build of {{ site.name }}, including download and installation of Gradle.

In order to run {{ site.name }} in development mode, follow these steps:

 1. Make sure that {{ site.name }} was built ok in accordance with the above.
 1. TODO
