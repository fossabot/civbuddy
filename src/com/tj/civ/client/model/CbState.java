/**
 * States that a card can be in.
 * 
 * <p>The states 'Owned' and 'Planned' are the major states, and the only ones
 * that can be explicitly set by the user and the only ones that are persisted.
 * All other states (the ones inside the shaded box in the diagrams below) are
 * detailings of the 'Absent' state, calculated at run time.
 * 
 * <h3>State Transitions</h3>
 * 
 * The state of a card can change explicitly (because the user clicked on the card),
 * or it can change implicitly (because another card's state was changed).
 * 
 * <p>The action mode determines which state transitions are possible.
 * 
 * <p>In <b>planning mode</b>, a click on any card could trigger the following
 * changes:
 *
 * <p><img src="doc-files/CardStates-Plan.png" alt="Card State Diagram - Planning Mode"
 *    style="margin-left:3em;" />
 *
 * <p>The red dashed arrows indicate transitions which would lead to a warning
 * message being displayed (if transitioning to 'Planned'). If the warning is
 * ignored, the state transition is performed.<br>
 * The transition between 'PrereqFailed' and 'DiscouragedBuy' is dashed, because
 * the game variants that the author knows do not include it. To make this
 * transition relevant, one of the cheap cards would have to have a prerequisite
 * card. However, this might happen in theory, so this app covers the possibility.<br>
 * 'Owned' is the final state that cards cannot leave. They reach this state only
 * by committing the cards flagged as planned.
 * 
 * <p>In <b>revise mode</b>, a click on any card could trigger the following changes:
 *
 * <p><img src="doc-files/CardStates-Revise.png" alt="Card State Diagram - Revise Mode"
 *    style="margin-left:3em;" />
 *
 * <p>Only the states 'Absent' and 'Owned' exist, and a user click toggles between
 * the two.
 * 
 * <h3>Mode Transitions</h3>
 * 
 * The above already made it clear that certain actions must be performed when the
 * action mode changes.
 * 
 * <p><dl>
 * <dt>Planning Mode -&gt; Revise Mode</dt>
 * <dd>Clear all plans, then set all cards not in state 'Owned' to state 'Absent'.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>Revise Mode -&gt; Planning Mode</dt>
 * <dd>Recalculate the detail states of all cards in state 'Absent'.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>Return from 'Funds' view -&gt 'Cards' view</dt>
 * <dd>Recalculate the detail states of all cards not in states 'Owned' or
 *     'Planned'.</dd>
 * </dl>
